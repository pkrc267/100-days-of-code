Day 1: Learning how to connect database with php and fetch data.

Day 2: could not devote much time today due to travelling. Although managed to display the fetched data from the database on the web page.

Day 3: learning about dynamic content display from database.

Day 4: learnt displaying dynamic content from database on webpage. Stuck on inserting form data in db.

Day 5: learnt about sessions in php, security features for password using md5 and validation of input fields in php.
	also: figured out the form data insertion into database using $_GET. But problem occurs everytime the form is submitted using $_POST. On using POST error occurs- Undefined variables (even when the variables are declared at the right place).
